        <p>Part of the inspiration for Dark Chibi was my exposure to the art of <a href=”http://miss-octopie.com/home.php”> Miss-Octopie</a>.  Besides the obvious stylistic influence, I was specifically intrigued by her use of color in line art. This spurred me to challenge myself to stop using pure black and grey in my art, and really push my experimentations with the interaction of light and color.  During this project I also developed some new custom brushes that have drastically sped up the process of blending colors in my work. Because of this I feel I can more quickly capture lighting, leaving me more time to creatively interpret light.

The project is based around creating a recognizable Intellectual property that can be used to theme and promote serialized content across multiple mediums. This project is an exercise in world building, allowing our team to create a set of characters, events, and settings that free us to tell the kinds of personal and big picture stories that inspire us across multiple mediums.
      </p>
      <p>We are currently in preproduction on two branded projects. The first is a webcomic meant to be a centerpiece for lore, story, character and world building for an expansive IP. The second project is a simple game production primarily focused on implementing a model view controller and other improvements to our pipeline design. We are not creating media, we are building a machine of talented individuals that creates quality media.

        <p>Derp Wars is an opinion piece aimed at critiquing Jar Jar’s place in the Star Wars prequels by examining the Darth Jar Jar fan theory. I created transformative parody art to illustrate this narrative.  It was an intense but short challenge of my ability to generate art quickly, write a cohesive argument, and bring these elements together with limited animations for a final video presentation.

        <p>An early project on my Twitch Channel Meat4every1, Rise of Rakshaza is the name of a proposed Fallout 4 mod.  The purpose of this project was to work through a mock preproduction exploring the viability of creating mods in the event that valve reinstated paid mods. In the concept art seen above the base character was used as a mannequin for the testing of various garments and equipment for look development.
        </p>
        <p>The concept art was crafted based on gameplay mechanics and lore surrounding the creature you see depicted.  In Fallout 4 ~200 years has passed since the great war. So much time has passed and the flora and fauna of the land has changed so drastically it is surprising to me that Bethesda has done very little to experiment with alternative cultural bases. Almost every culture we see in Fallout is directly linked to the pre war world. They live in pre war buildings, wear pre war clothes, use a pre war language etc. Everything is set in a Mad Max aesthetic, all spikes, leather, and rusted technology. But in this project I propose that with culture and society so thoroughly demolished, 200 years later we would begin to see cultures that had formed completely outside the direct influence of what had come before. With new species of sentient humanoids roaming the land in the form of sentient ghouls and super mutants, the shape of what a new society would look like begins to take form. Less Mad Max, more Apocalypto.

        </p>
        <p>The other side of the idea was the loose connection the Fallout lore has always had with the occult; fortune tellers, aliens, ghosts, all make an appearance in Fallout games from time to time. With the link Bethesda has recently suggested between The Elder Scrolls series and Fallout, the idea for Rakshaza as the first truly magical installment in the Fallout universe began to take shape
        </p>
        <p>The concept that formed from these two ideas was a society of sentient ghouls called the Rakshaza. This new Fallout faction would be characterized by their ability to control radiation within their own body to cast spells, buffs, or use other abilities. To the player this would mean having the ability to leverage that red radiation buildup on their health as a mana bar, Introducing what amounts to lore freindly blood and fire magic. The plan was to implement the core mechanic of leveraging radiation buildup as a resource in a small self contained mod with some basic abilities and spells. From there we would incrementally incorporate more mechanics, scenarios, equipment, spells, npcs, factions, etc. Until we were satisfied with the project as whole.

          <p>Singularity was the working title of an exploratory prototype project between myself and Speck.Tech. The project was focused on determining whether or not a conceptualize mobile game idea could be viable produced based on our time and resource limitations. The high concept was to create a puzzle game where players had little to no direct control over in game agents. Players would instead act through AI built using a rudimentary block based coding system similar to educational languages like scratch. These AI agents would interact with the world on your behalf and be built with increasingly complex code libraries to solve increasingly complex puzzles.  The purpose of this gameplay was to educate players on basic coding concepts, if statements, loops etc. in directed sandbox environments. The target audience was school age people with an interest in coding but no educational outlet to experiment with these interests. We wanted to give these young people a sense of ownership over coding concepts, by linking these concepts directly with their own interactive creations.
          </p>
            <p>During this exploratory prototyping phase we developed aspects of the UI and game world to functional completion, and created a robust plan for required development. Upon reaching this point we felt we had a full understanding of the project's complexity and requirements. Analyzing the needs of the project, the timeline of development to this point, and the expected timeline for prototype completion, we decided that our development goals would be better served by redirecting towards a smaller scale project.  We have high hopes for the future of Singularity, and fully intend to reexamine it if and when we have more resources we can leverage to address development concerns.  We have since redirected our efforts towards serialized storytelling in our new Webcomic, and plan to do another small scale game prototype focused on pipeline design.

        <p>The Meat4every1 Twitch channel was born from a need to combine the time I spend working on art or relaxing with a video game, with my desire to build a creative community of likeminded technophiles, gamers, artists, and everyone inbetween. The channel began in earnest October 2015. From that point until late April 2016 I maintained a schedule of at least three hours a day five days a week. During this period I developed a pipeline for maintaining a daily broadcast, incrementally improving the look and branding, while taking the personal steps necessary to improve as a performer. Over the course of the seven months of daily streaming I completed more digital illustrations than in the last seven years. It was enlightening and empowering to see my skills improve so drastically in such a short period. The explosion of quality and quantity in my 2016 portfolio is directly attributed to my Twitch Creative schedule. During my time on Twitch I have constructed a professional grade stream setup in my home studio. I have a two computer setup linked by a capture card allowing me to split tasks intuitively between the two rigs and maximize performance in games and art applications. I am confident that I could run the technical aspects and perform on a Twitch station to fulfill the professional broadcasting needs of others if called to do so. From a personal improvement and production pipeline perspective, Meat4every1 on Twitch has been a huge success.
        </p>
        <p>After seven months of streaming I have come to the conclusion that Twitch Creative has a lot of growing to do before it is useful as a promotional platform. When I learned streamers like Ross from Game Grumps are only marginally successful (~200 viewers) my expectations of reaching or exceeding that kind of viewership were diminished. With that in mind I have since significantly cut back on my streaming schedule. Up to this point I have laid the groundwork for the creation of professional and entertaining serialized content on Twitch and other online streaming platforms. I am incredibly proud of the progress made and I will continue to develop and improve Meat4every1 as a Twitch brand and beyond.

            The creation of this project was documented in this <a href="">developement blog</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              The project portion of my Master's Thesis at Drexel University, Dead End was a ~15 minute survival horror game, developed over the course of 4 Months. All aspects of this game, code, art, etc. were created by myself during this period. The one exception to this was the in engine video recording plugin AVPRO Movie Capture generously donated by RenderHeads.
          </p>

            <p>The purpose of my thesis was to test two hypothesis. The first, that the externally displayed emotions of a player character (PC) in a third person perspective horror game would influence the emotional state of the player during the course of gameplay. The second, that this emotional shift would impact player performance. 40 students at Drexel University were tested. They were split into 2 groups. In one group the PC was animated to express fear. The other group used a PC animated to express confidence. The results were collected through metrics culled directly from gameplay, and post play session interviews. The metrics, compared between the two groups showed no statistically significant difference in performance between the two groups. The interviews however showed that players viewed the experience and their performance differently between the two groups, the fear group favoring negative accounts and language and the confident group favoring positive accounts and language.
