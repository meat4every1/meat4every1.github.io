<p> My education and work have afforded me a broad skillset within digital media including but not limited to Web dev, animation, and game development. I am highly skilled in traditional and digital illustration, digital sculpture, and other artistic disciplines. I can create in a wide variety of styles to meet the needs of a given projects art direction. My focus is primarily on game character creation, from conception through creation and setup, to mechanics development and integration. I also have experience in interface design, shader writing, character fx, simulation, and game prototyping.
